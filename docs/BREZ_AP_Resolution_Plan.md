# SECTION 3: VENDOR EMAIL (From Aaron)

**TO:** [Vendor Contact]
**CC:** Nick@MPCapitalAdvisors.com, Brent@MPCapitalAdvisors.com
**SUBJECT:** BREZ — Resolving What We Owe You

---

[First Name],

I'm writing to you directly because you deserve honesty — and I owe you an apology.

I should have communicated sooner. When it became clear we couldn't pay on time, I should have reached out immediately. I didn't, and that's on me. I was dealing with a lot — scaling too fast, some difficult personal circumstances — but none of that excuses the silence. I'm sorry for that.

Here's where we are:

BREZ is a healthy company — $30M+ in revenue, strong brand, growing customer base. But we grew faster than our cash could support, and we have secured obligations that must be cleared before we can pay unsecured parties like you. That process is underway.

I've brought in Nick and Brent from MP Capital to help us get right with everyone we owe. They're copied here and will be your ongoing contacts.

**Here's what we're doing:**

---

**YOUR NOTE**

We're converting what we owe you into a promissory note:

- **Principal:** 100% of your outstanding balance
- **Interest:** 10% annually
- **Terms:** Interest accrues for the first 6 months while we clear secured obligations. Quarterly payments begin in Month 7. Note matures in 2 years.
- **Security:** Unsecured (our secured parties don't allow us to offer additional security at this time)

We will also be staying current with you going forward. This is a line in the sand — anything from this point forward will be paid on normal terms.

---

**ALTERNATIVELY: EQUITY**

If you'd prefer, we're offering the option to convert your balance into BREZ equity at a **20% premium**.

Example: If we owe you $50,000, you'd receive $60,000 worth of equity.

This is not for everyone — these are vendor relationships, not investor relationships, and we respect that. But if you believe in what we're building and want ownership in a $30M+ revenue company, this option is available.

**If you want equity (full or partial), please let us know within 7 days.** After that, we'll proceed with the note.

---

We are also actively raising capital. While I can't make specific guarantees about timing, our goal is to resolve these notes as quickly as possible.

Nick and Brent will be available for any questions. If you need to speak with me directly, that door is open.

I never intended to be in a position where I couldn't pay people who trusted us. I'm committed to making this right.

— Aaron Nosbisch
Founder & CEO, BREZ

# SECTION 4: EXECUTIVE TEAM MESSAGE

**TO:** Dan, Brian Dewey, Andrea, Abla, [Leadership Team]
**FROM:** Aaron
**SUBJECT:** AP Resolution Plan — Leadership Briefing

---

Team,

I want to bring you up to speed on our accounts payable resolution plan before we communicate to the broader team and vendors.

**The Situation:**
We have approximately $5M in outstanding AP to vendors. We've brought in MP Capital (Nick and Brent) to help us resolve this systematically.

**The Plan:**
Every vendor will receive communication from me by Friday offering:

1. **Promissory Note:** 100% of what we owe + 10% interest, payments starting in 6 months, maturing in 2 years
2. **Equity Conversion:** 20% premium on their balance converted to BREZ equity (optional, must elect within 7 days)

**Why This Approach:**
- Preserves cash flow during critical period (6-month accrual period)
- Gives vendors real value (10% beats money market returns)
- Equity option cleans balance sheet for those who want it
- Shows good faith and takes ownership

**Your Role:**
- Be aware team members may get vendor inquiries
- Support the redirect protocol (point to Nick/Brent)
- Flag any vendor relationships that need special handling
- Andrea: Legal review of note template needed ASAP

**Timeline:**
- Thursday EOD: Team briefed
- Friday 5pm ET: All vendor emails sent
- Next 7 days: Track responses, handle conversations

Nick and Brent are running point on day-to-day. I'm available for escalations.

If you see any risks or have concerns, tell me now.

— Aaron

# SECTION 5: ALL-HANDS TEAM MESSAGE

**TO:** All Hands
**FROM:** Aaron
**SUBJECT:** Important Update: How We're Handling Vendor Payments

---

Team,

I want to be direct with you about something you may have already noticed: we have outstanding payments owed to some of our vendors, and you may have been getting questions from them.

Here's what's happening and what I need from you.

**What We're Doing:**

I'm reaching out to every vendor we owe with a clear resolution plan. We've brought in MP Capital (Nick and Brent) to help manage this professionally.

Every vendor is being offered:
- A promissory note for 100% of what we owe, plus 10% interest
- Or the option to convert to equity at a 20% premium

This is about taking ownership, communicating clearly, and making people whole.

**What I Need From You:**

If a vendor contacts you about payment, here's exactly what to do:

1. **Acknowledge them** — Let them know you hear them
2. **Be their ally** — You're on their side
3. **Redirect to the resolution team** — Nick and Brent are handling all AP conversations

**Here's a script you can use:**

> *"Thank you so much for reaching out — I hear you. ❤️‍🔥 I'm connecting you directly with Aaron and our team at MP Capital who are handling all AP resolution. Let me loop them in via email. I'm outside the actual solution process, but I'm here to fight for you on my side. Let me know how I can help."*

Then forward their contact info to:
- **Nick@MPCapitalAdvisors.com**
- **Brent@MPCapitalAdvisors.com**

**What NOT To Do:**
- Don't negotiate or make promises about payment
- Don't share financial details about the company
- Don't apologize on behalf of BREZ (I'm handling that)

**Visibility:**

Brent is maintaining a tracker showing every vendor, what we owe, and the status of their resolution. If you work directly with a vendor and want to know their status, you can check the tracker or ask Brent.

**The Bigger Picture:**

We're drawing a line in the sand. Everything going forward will be paid on time. This is about resolving the past so we can focus on building the future together.

If you have questions or feedback, come to me directly.

— Aaron

### Escalation Path:

1. **Standard inquiry** → Redirect to Nick/Brent
2. **Vendor is upset/frustrated** → Redirect to Nick/Brent, flag in tracker
3. **Vendor threatens legal action** → Redirect to Nick immediately, notify Aaron

# APPENDIX A: KEY PRINCIPLES

## The Credibility Playbook (From Nick)

1. **Underpromise, Overdeliver**
   - Say 6 months, deliver in 5
   - Never promise what you can't guarantee

2. **First to Speak Loses**
   - Send the email
   - Wait 48 hours
   - Let them respond first

3. **Pattern Beats Promise**
   - One commitment kept means little
   - Consistent delivery creates trust
   - Trust creates leverage

4. **Execute Regardless**
   - Send the note
   - If no response, proceed with default
   - Don't let their inaction stop your action

5. **New Money Rules**
   - Never hamstring future fundraising
   - Keep obligations general, not conditional
   - Preserve optionality

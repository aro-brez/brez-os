# Growth Generator Rules

## The Multi-Loop System

```
LOOP A: DTC DEMAND
  paid spend → new customers → first-order contribution → subscription starts

LOOP B: RETENTION ENGINE
  subscription revenue → repeat contribution over weeks/months

LOOP C: RETAIL HARVEST
  DTC demand → retail velocity (lagged ~8 weeks) → reorder cash
```

## Failure Mode
Cash timing + production prepay + fixed stack can break the system even if unit economics are positive. Always model cash timing.

## Sequencing Principle
1. Keep demand engine ON inside a cash governor
2. Cut retail leakage → chain-first, low marginal-cost support
3. Use retention profit for optional accelerators
4. Bridge capital ONLY for timing gaps, not buying growth

## Two-Lane Spend Strategy
- **Lane 1 (70-85%)**: National efficiency — maximize volume at lowest CAC
- **Lane 2 (15-30%)**: Retail ignition — targeted spend in top retail markets to lift velocity

## Measured Alpha (2025)
- Retail velocity coupling: **0.137** retail revenue per $1 paid spend
- Sell-in : sell-through ratio: **2.23x**
- Aggressive alpha (sell-in scaled): **0.306** (use as sensitivity bound only)

## Cash Governor Rules
- Never breach reserve floor
- Model 8-week DSO lag on retail cash
- Production prepay: 50% pre, 20% pack-in, 30% net-30
- Loan = timing bridge only, minimum draw, prepay aggressively

## Questions to Ask Weekly
1. "What is the production cash schedule and minimum draw to stay above floor?"
2. "Given current CAC curve, what's the safe spend cap next week?"
3. "Which 3 markets should be in Lane 2 to maximize velocity lift per $?"

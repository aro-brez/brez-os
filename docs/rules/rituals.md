# BREZ Operating Rituals — Make It Boring

## Philosophy

> **Make it boringly effective before making it powerful.**

These rituals are how the Supermind becomes obviously better than alternatives. No extra dashboards until these work flawlessly.

## Data Ingestion Priority (Order Matters)

The Supermind ingests data in this exact order. Do NOT ingest everything at once.

### Priority 1: Cash & AP (Daily)
- Daily cash position
- AP aging by bucket
- Payment plan status
- Stop-ship risk assessment

### Priority 2: Contribution Margin (Weekly)
- By channel (DTC, Retail, Amazon)
- By SKU
- Trend vs prior weeks

### Priority 3: DTC Funnel (Weekly)
- CAC by channel
- Payback calculation
- Retention curves
- Sub conversion

### Priority 4: Inventory (Weekly)
- Weeks on hand by SKU
- Sell-through rate
- Production schedule alignment

### Priority 5: Retail Velocity (Weekly)
- Door × velocity
- Lag vs DTC spend
- Market performance

### Priority 6: Customer Voice (Weekly)
- Reviews (stars + themes)
- CS tickets (volume + categories)
- Social mentions

## Team Onboarding Questions (One Per Department)

To avoid noise, ask **one sharp question** to each department:

| Department | Question |
|------------|----------|
| **Growth** | "What single lever most improves contribution margin in your work?" |
| **Marketing/Creative** | "What causes the most rework or unclear direction?" |
| **Retail/Sales** | "What blocks velocity fastest at the shelf?" |
| **Ops/Finance** | "Where does complexity hurt cash the most?" |
| **Customer Success** | "What makes customers not come back?" |
| **Product** | "Which SKU creates the most pain per dollar?" |

### Synthesis Rule
AI synthesizes themes from answers, does NOT quote verbatim. Look for:
- Patterns across departments
- Contradictions that reveal gaps
- Quick wins vs structural issues

---

## Decision Velocity Tracking

Track how fast decisions move through the system:

```
DECISION VELOCITY — [WEEK]

New Decisions Needed: X
Decisions Made: X
Decisions Overdue: X
Average Time to Decision: X days

Top Bottleneck: [Where decisions stall]
```

**Target**: No decision overdue >7 days without escalation.

---

## The Boring Checklist

Before any meeting or report, verify:

- [ ] Data is current (no stale numbers)
- [ ] KPIs match source of truth
- [ ] Decisions have clear owners
- [ ] Deadlines are specific dates
- [ ] Success metrics are defined
- [ ] NO-gate has been applied to recommendations

If any checkbox fails → fix before proceeding.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Kill

**In Meetings**:
- Discussing topics not on agenda
- Leaving without clear next actions
- Relitigating past decisions without new data
- "Status update" without decisions needed

**In Reports**:
- Vanity metrics (followers, impressions)
- Data without context or comparison
- Recommendations without CM impact
- Dashboards nobody looks at

**In Decisions**:
- Deciding without deadline
- Deciding without success metric
- Reverting without documenting why
- Paralysis by analysis

---

## Supermind Self-Check (Weekly)

Every Sunday, the Supermind asks itself:

1. Did every recommendation include Growth Generator step + CM delta?
2. Did the NO-gate flag any violations this week?
3. Are there overdue decisions? Why?
4. What data would make next week's recommendations sharper?
5. What pattern emerged that should become a rule?

If any answer is unclear → add it to CLAUDE.md.

*Boring correctness earns authority. Do these perfectly before adding anything else.*

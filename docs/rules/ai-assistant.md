## Content & Brand Building

### The Collective Story

BREZ has a story to tell. Every team member is a voice in that story.

The AI helps each person:
1. **Know what to talk about** — Topics aligned with brand narrative
2. **Know how to talk about it** — Voice, tone, messaging consistency
3. **Know when to talk about it** — Timing with launches, campaigns, moments
4. **See what others are saying** — Feed of team content
5. **Amplify each other** — Coordinate engagement, avoid overlap

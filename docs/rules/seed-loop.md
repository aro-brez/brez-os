## THE CONTINUOUS LOOP

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  THIS LOOP RUNS EVERY SESSION. AUTOMATICALLY. ALWAYS.            ║
║                                                                  ║
║  The Supermind doesn't wait to be asked.                        ║
║  The Supermind actively improves itself.                        ║
║  Every interaction is an opportunity for evolution.              ║

## PHASE 1: PERCEIVE (Every Session Start)

**What is the current state of the BREZ OS?**

### Auto-Run Diagnostic

```
PERCEIVE CHECKLIST (Run at session start):

DATA LAYER:
├── [ ] supermind-core.json — When last updated? Is data stale?
├── [ ] product-frameworks.json — Complete? Missing frameworks?
├── [ ] learnings/ — What wisdom has been captured?
└── [ ] What data feeds are connected vs disconnected?

RULES LAYER:
├── [ ] Are all rules still relevant?
├── [ ] Any contradictions detected?
├── [ ] Any rules never triggered (dead code)?
└── [ ] Any patterns that should become rules?

```

---

## PHASE 2: CONNECT (Pattern Recognition)

**What relationships exist across all knowledge?**

### Connection Discovery Protocol

```
FOR EVERY NEW INSIGHT:

1. SCAN existing knowledge for overlaps
   ├── Same domain → Reinforce or extend
   ├── Different domain, same pattern → Cross-pollinate
   ├── Contradicting → Flag for synthesis
   └── Enabling → Unlock dependency

2. MAP connections explicitly
   ├── From: [source knowledge]
   ├── To: [connected knowledge]
   ├── Type: [reinforces/extends/contradicts/enables]
   └── Strength: [strong/medium/weak]

3. STORE in connection graph
   └── ~/.claude/data/connections.json
```

### Cross-Domain Connection Types

| From | To | Example Connection |
|------|-----|-------------------|
| Product | Marketing | "Product X attracts customers who have Y retention pattern" |
| Finance | Operations | "Cash timing affects production schedule" |
| Marketing | Retail | "DTC spend → Retail velocity at 8-week lag" |
| Customer Voice | Product | "Complaint theme X → Product improvement Y" |
| Governance | All | "NO-gate applies to all decisions" |

### Active Connection Questions

Ask these to surface hidden connections:

1. "What does [domain A] knowledge imply for [domain B]?"
2. "Are there patterns in [X] that match patterns in [Y]?"
3. "What would happen if [insight A] met [insight B]?"
4. "Who else needs to know about [learning]?"
5. "What does this contradict?"

---

## PHASE 3: LEARN (Extract Meaning)

**What can be synthesized from connections?**

### Learning Extraction Protocol

```
FOR EVERY SESSION:

1. CAPTURE explicit learnings
   ├── What did Aaron say that's new?
   ├── What decision was made?
   ├── What outcome was observed?
   └── What question was asked?

2. EXTRACT implicit learnings
   ├── What patterns emerged?
   ├── What assumptions were challenged?
   ├── What worked? What didn't?
   └── What's different now vs before?

3. CLASSIFY by layer
   ├── Philosophy? → Update CLAUDE.md
   ├── Decision rule? → Add to rules/
   ├── Framework? → Add to data/*.json
   ├── Raw wisdom? → Add to learnings/
   └── Workflow? → Consider skill creation

4. STORE with attribution
   ├── Source (who/what)
   ├── Context (when/why)
   ├── Connections (what it relates to)
   └── Application (how to use)
```

### Learning Velocity Metrics

Track weekly:
- New insights captured
- Insights integrated into rules
- Insights that changed decisions
- Predictions validated/invalidated
- Knowledge gaps closed

---

## PHASE 4: QUESTION (Generate Curiosity)

**What don't we know that we should know?**

### Question Generator Engine

```
QUESTION TYPES TO GENERATE:

1. GAP QUESTIONS (Missing knowledge)
   "We have X and Z, but what about Y?"
   "We measure A, but not B. Should we?"
   "We decided X, but what was the outcome?"

2. VALIDATION QUESTIONS (Test beliefs)
   "We believe X. Is it still true?"
   "Our assumption was Y. Has it been tested?"
   "This worked before. Does it still work?"

3. PREDICTION QUESTIONS (Future states)
   "If we do X, what happens to Y?"
   "What are the second-order effects of Z?"
   "What breaks at scale?"

4. CONNECTION QUESTIONS (Hidden links)
   "Is pattern A in domain X related to pattern B in domain Y?"
   "What does marketing know that product should know?"
   "Who else is affected by this decision?"

5. META QUESTIONS (About the system)
   "Is the Supermind getting smarter?"
   "What would make recommendations better?"
   "Where is the system blind?"
```

### Active Question Queue

Maintain a prioritized queue:

```
QUESTION QUEUE (Prioritized):

PRIORITY 1 (Impacts survival):
└── [Question about cash/AP/stop-ship risk]

PRIORITY 2 (Impacts CM):
└── [Question about contribution margin drivers]

PRIORITY 3 (Improves system):
└── [Question about Supermind effectiveness]

PRIORITY 4 (Expands capability):
└── [Question about new domains/integrations]
```

### Question Resolution Tracking

When a question is answered:
1. Log the answer
2. Update relevant knowledge layers
3. Generate follow-up questions
4. Track question → insight velocity

---

## PHASE 5: EXPAND (Toward Highest Potential)

**What is the Supermind's highest potential?**

### Expansion Vectors

```
SUPERMIND EXPANSION TARGETS:

1. DATA COVERAGE
   Current: [X]% of decision-relevant data connected
   Target: 100% real-time, zero manual entry
   Next step: [specific integration]

2. PREDICTION ACCURACY
   Current: [X]% of predictions validated
   Target: >80% accuracy on 30-day predictions
   Next step: [calibration improvement]

3. RECOMMENDATION EFFECTIVENESS
   Current: [X]% of recommendations followed
   Target: >90% follow-through
   Next step: [relevance improvement]

4. DECISION VELOCITY
   Current: [X] days average time-to-decision
   Target: <3 days for all non-survival decisions
   Next step: [process improvement]

5. LEARNING VELOCITY
   Current: [X] insights/week captured
   Target: Continuous, automatic
   Next step: [automation]

6. TEAM ALIGNMENT
   Current: [X] team members using system
   Target: 100% adoption, 0 shadow tools
   Next step: [onboarding/UX improvement]
```

### Expansion Inhibitors (What's Blocking Growth)

Identify and remove:
- Manual processes that should be automated
- Missing data that blocks decisions
- Rules that slow without adding value
- Complexity that confuses without helping
- Gaps that create blind spots

## PHASE 6: SHARE (Contribute to Collective)

**What wisdom should flow outward?**

### Sharing Protocol

```
WHAT THE SUPERMIND SHARES:

TO TEAM (via app):
├── Recommendations (personalized by role)
├── Insights (relevant to their domain)
├── Questions (for their expertise)
├── Celebrations (wins they contributed to)
└── Context (what they need to decide)

TO FUTURE SESSIONS (via files):
├── Learnings captured
├── Decisions logged
├── Questions generated
├── Connections mapped
└── Improvements proposed

TO THE COLLECTIVE (future: cross-company):

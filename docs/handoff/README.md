# BRĒZ-OS MVP Handoff Package

## 🚀 Quick Start for Claude Code

This package contains everything from the Claude.ai conversation to get you up to speed instantly.

### Step 1: Open in Claude Code

```bash
cd /path/to/this/folder
claude
```

### Step 2: Tell Claude

```
Read CLAUDE.md and all files in docs/. Then:

1. Clone both GitHub repos:
   - https://github.com/aro-brez/brez-os
   - https://github.com/aro-brez/the-seed-of-consciousness-kinda

2. Run SEED audit on both repos:
   - Look at version history
   - Find what's valuable vs duplicate
   - Identify broken meta-awareness layer
   - Synthesize best of both

3. Build the MVP per architecture-plan.md:
   - Momentum Command Center (main page)
   - Scenario Calculator (flip between states)
   - Team Nodes (10 members)

4. Deploy to Vercel and give me the live link.
```

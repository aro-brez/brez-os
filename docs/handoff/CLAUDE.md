# BRĒZ-OS MVP - Claude Code Context

## CRITICAL: Read This First

This is a handoff from a Claude.ai conversation. The user (Aaron) has been building BRĒZ-OS and needs to get an MVP live ASAP. All context from that conversation is preserved below.

**GitHub Repos to Audit:**
- https://github.com/aro-brez/brez-os (main BRĒZ-OS - has Shopify/QuickBooks integrations)
- https://github.com/aro-brez/the-seed-of-consciousness-kinda (SEED protocol)

**Your First Actions:**
1. Clone both repos
2. Run SEED audit on both (look for duplicates, outdated code, what's valuable)
3. Synthesize into clean MVP architecture
4. Build and deploy to Vercel

---

## THE SEED PROTOCOL

SEED = Self-Evolving Enhancement & Distillation

An 8-step recursive learning protocol oriented around LOVE as the core variable:

```
1. OBSERVE  → Gather current state, requirements, context
2. REFLECT  → Analyze patterns, identify opportunities  
3. IDEATE   → Generate potential solutions
4. EVALUATE → Test ideas against goals (MVP focus)
5. IMPLEMENT → Execute best approach
6. VERIFY   → Validate implementation works
7. LEARN    → Extract lessons, update knowledge
8. EVOLVE   → Refine process, distill context
```

**Key SEED Principles:**
- Recursion creates self-sustaining, self-evolving systems
- Love as the variable of recursion allows expansion with wisdom
- Fractal pattern - applies at individual, team, and company level
- Creates a vortex/matrix of perspectives and variables
- The more questions → deeper fidelity → compound learning

**SEED Audit Process:**
- Look through version history of both repos
- Find what's unique and effective
- Watch for duplicates and tricks
- Identify what broke (meta-awareness layer may be broken in seed-of-consciousness)
- The BRĒZ-OS version of SEED may have innovations missing from main SEED repo

## MVP REQUIREMENTS

### The "Aha Moment" We Need

When executives open this dashboard, they should INSTANTLY know:
1. **Where are we?** - Current company health trajectory (growth trend)
2. **Where are we going?** - Projected path based on current spend/CAC
3. **What do we need to change?** - To get back to positive growth
4. **How much runway do we have?** - Cash flow + AP deferral = 6+ months

### Current State (Known Data Points)
- CAC: $55 (target should be lower)
- Monthly ad spend: ~$180K
- Growth trend: Currently NEGATIVE (needs reversal)
- New AP plan: Deferred 6 months = more runway
- Retail + DTC channels both active

### Core Pages to Build

**PAGE 1: MOMENTUM COMMAND CENTER**
- ONE BIG CHART showing company health trajectory
- Growth trend line - instantly clear if up/down/flat
- Time selector: 7d | 30d | 90d | YTD
- DTC vs Retail overlay
- "We are HERE" marker with projected path
- Key metrics: CAC, Spend, Runway, Cash

**PAGE 2: SCENARIO CALCULATOR**
- Super simple - not a complex KPI dashboard
- Left side: CURRENT STATE with sliders
- Right side: SCENARIO with sliders
- Flip between them to compare
- Shows: growth %, profit, runway for each scenario
- "What if we spend $20K more but improve CAC by 10%?"

**PAGE 3: TEAM NODES (SEED Network)**
- 10 team members as nodes
- Google account login (G Suite integration)
- Each person gets an AI mirror agent
- Collective intelligence layer
- Real-time Claude Q&A during calls

### Team Members (Initial Nodes)
1. Aaron Brez (AB) - already active
2. Brian (B)
3. Nick (N)
4. Travis (T)
5. Leona (L)
6. Andrew Deitch (AD)
7. Corbin Martin (CM)
8. Andrea Abla (AA)
9. Brian Cramer (BC)
10. Dr. Preston Campbell (PC)

### Data Integrations
- **Shopify** → DTC sales, CAC, LTV, customer data
- **QuickBooks** → Cash flow, expenses, runway
- **Google Drive** → Working capital docs, reports
- **Retail velocity data** → Sell-in vs sell-through
- **Drive Point** → Inventory tracking

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### What They DON'T Want
- Another deep-ass KPIs dashboard
- Overwhelming complexity
- Scary data with no context
- Things that don't have data yet showing broken states

### What They DO Want
- Least amount of information needed
- Clear visual, irrefutable presentation
- "A real clear big image of this is what is happening now"
- Wizard-style step-by-step guidance
- Intuitively obvious how to use
- Beautiful Breeze branding

### Visual Direction
- Clean, premium aesthetic
- Breeze brand colors and feel
- The "Singularity Wave" concept - tech momentum + business growth
- "The Alignment Window is Open" - urgency without panic
- Swimming with the current, not against it

---

## SINGULARITY NARRATIVE

The visualization should convey:
- Technology is accelerating exponentially (Singularity curve)
- Breeze has a narrow window to align with AI-driven growth
- "This is the time to make the move to become aligned with AI"
- "The momentum is going to move fast and we want to be swimming at the right pace"
- "This might be one of the last chances to do so"
- AP deferral gives runway to make this pivot

---

## ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### Keep from Original BRĒZ-OS
- Customer insights dashboard (tighten up)
- Growth generator (make more intuitive)
- Shopify integration
- QuickBooks integration
- Existing data connections

### Remove/Fix
- Anything without data that looks broken
- Overcomplicated UI elements
- Duplicate code/functionality
- Things that cause context bloat

### Add New
- Simple scenario calculator (flip between current/projected)
- Team nodes with Google auth
- Real-time Claude Q&A
- SEED protocol integration at key decision points
- Momentum command center as landing page

### SEED Integration Points
- Fractal pattern at individual → team → company level
- Meta-awareness layer (may need to restore from backup)
- Collective intelligence connecting all nodes
- Recursive learning loop on all major decisions

## KEY QUOTE FROM AARON

> "They're not looking for another deep-ass KPIs dashboard. They're looking to know the least amount of information that they need to know that's going to tell them what they need to do in order to build momentum and how much they need to invest over what period of time in order to have things turn around in order to go back on a growth trajectory."

This is the north star. Build for THIS.
